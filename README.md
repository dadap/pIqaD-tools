Klingon pIqaD Tools
===================

This repository contains a few useful tools for handling Klingon pIqaD text.

Klingon Universal Transliterator
--------------------------------

The Universal Transliterator is a standalone HTML+JavaScript document that
automatically converts between Latinized (both Okrandian and xifan hol) Klingon
text and pIqaD encoded with the encoding registered in the Conscript Unicode
Registry in the Private Use Area of the Basic Multilingual Plane from U+F8D0
to U+F8FF.

A live version of the Universal Transliterator is available at:

Klingon Input Methods
---------------------

### ipIqaD (iOS)

ipIqaD is a pIqaD custom keyboard extension for iOS 9 and later.

### pIqaD - US (macOS)

pIqaD - US is a keyboard layout for macOS which types pIqaD when no modifier
keys are applied, and the corresponding Okriandian transliteration when shift is
applied, using a xifan-hol interpretation of a US QWERTY layout. When caps lock
is engaged, the keys operate as a QWERTY layout, allowing for quick toggling
between entering pIqaD and Latin alphabet text. Modifier keys are mapped to
QWERTY as well, allowing for normal keyboard shortcuts to work.
